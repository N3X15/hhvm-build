# HHVM Package Sources

This is my own spin on Facebook's HHVM packaging system.  Instead of using a mess of bash scripts, this uses python and is far more reliable, while providing more information to the log in case a problem occurs.

Used for internal .deb packaging via Freight and FPM, run via Jenkins.
